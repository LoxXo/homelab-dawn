# homelab-dawn - A journey to own HomeLab
## Created in draw.io
### General assumptions:
* UPC router in router mode
* Single VLAN for now
* Lowest possible power consumption
* No option to connect HomeLab and MediaEnd via cable
### Timeline
05/03/2024 - PoC completed. Need to decide on hardware. Specially if I want hardware router(w/ hotspot) OpneWRT as next in line from UPC router or move it to VM and use any hardware AP.
